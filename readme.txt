this is a simple shell of homework when i read the chapter 8 of csapp.
there are some points the program has finished.
   1).run the program(not system builtin,namely, need  indicate the path).
   2).backgrounp work.
   3).receive the signal "SIGINT" and "SIGTSTP".
   4).recover the bg work.
   5).recycle the defunct proc.
